# Access-control-with-RFID
This project implements a user authentication system using RFID tags, with access control managed by an ESP32. The firmware handles RFID reading and operates a stepper motor to control a lock, while a separate software manages authentication. Communication uses the MQTT protocol for robust and scalable integration.
